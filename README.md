# autocoder_external

This repository contains a compiled external and examples for loading models trained for an autocoder, an implementation of a variational autoencoder (VAE), into Max/MSP. The external only runs on ARM based Macs and Max/MSP 8.2 or newer.

There are two examples, a very basic one and a second one that requires Ircam's spat to be installed.

For more details on the AI and its architecture, please see the [main autocoder repository](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder).

To train models for the autocoder, see [Link text Here](https://link-url-here.org).
